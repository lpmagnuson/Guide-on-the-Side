About
-----------------

The University of Arizona Libraries is pleased to announce the open source 
release of the Guide on the Side tutorial creation software. The Guide on 
the Side software is a freely available tool that allows librarians to quickly
 and easily create online, interactive tutorials that are based on the 
principles of authentic and active learning. An example can be viewed here:
